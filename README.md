- here are screenshots of the project in the folder. There are also air quality indices based on the screenshots. You can open Matlab code files (.m) with MATLAB. Fuzzy Toolbox must be installed for the Toolbox file (.fis).

Three input parameters, SO2, PM10 and CO, were used in the prepared model. The concentrations of these parameters were named as predicted air pollution parameters. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) standards for pollutant parameters were used as data sets. A model of 3 inputs and 1 output was constructed and the air pollution index was estimated. With the Fuzzy Toolbox used, triangle and trapezoid membership functions were used. 26 rules were created and values estimated. Later, membership functions were defined with matlab. In the code written with the classical methods used, predictions were obtained as a result of the rinsing process. The predictions obtained with the code are compared with the toolbox results.

# Result:
Modeling gives successful results when a suitable database is selected. As in classical statistical and functional modeling techniques, it is tested using several parameters with methods and the model with the highest generalization capability appears. Much better results can be obtained by expanding the database in terms of quantity and quality as well as including other pollutant parameters in the model. Besides the daily usage amounts of fuels such as coal, fuel oil, natural gas used, the condition of motor vehicles is among the parameters affecting air pollution. By adding these parameters to the model, the effects of pollution on the basis of source are also addressed and more sensitive results can be obtained.
